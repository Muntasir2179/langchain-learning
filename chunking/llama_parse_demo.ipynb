Regulation of Command and Control. The command and control of the Army is regulated by devolution of powers, duties and responsibilities. The government will define the functions of the Chief of Army Staff, who in turn, will allocate to his staff, subordinate commanders, heads of Arms, Services and Departments, the duties to be carried out by them. These authorities will accordingly specify the responsibilities of their subordinates.\\n\\nThis decentralization of control will be published in the regulations, orders or instructions of the respective authorities.\\n\\n16. Each authority in the chain of control and every individual, to whom any duty is entrusted, will be entirely responsible for the judicious discharge thereof. Each higher authority will devise efficient machinery and procedure for ensuring proper execution of the policy laid down and exercise of powers delegated by them.\\n\\nIn grave emergency, nothing will absolve the senior officer present from his obligation to assume control under the conditions laid down in AR (Instruction) 160. On such occasions, where timely communication with higher authorities is impracticable, the responsibility for deciding whether or not the situation requires intervention rests with senior officer himself.\\n\\n17. Formation commanders are responsible for the efficiency and economic working of their units, and in respect of AHQ troops for such aspects of local administration as are placed under their control. Representatives of Arms and Services will bring to the notice of formation commanders any misuse or waste which may come to their notice or wasteful methods in the system of their Arms and Services.\\n\\n# Section 1—Commanders.\\n\\n# The Supreme Commander.\\n\\n18. The President is the Supreme Commander of the Armed forces.\\n\\n# The Chief of Army Staff.\\n\\n19. He is responsible for the command, discipline, training, administration, organization and preparedness for war of the Army in keeping with the policy outlined by the Government, from time to time. He is the Chief Executive in Army Headquarters and is an adviser to the Government on military matters.\\n\\n# Section 2—The Staff and \"Attached Arms\".\\n\\n# The Staff.\\n\\n20.

Introductory. The handling and maintenance of modern weapons and equipment and their impact on the army organization has resulted in the manpower being classified on the basis of technical skill required in various types of employment. The conditions of enrolment, initial and subsequent training and administration of the soldier are so regulated as to enable him to achieve the highest degree of professional efficiency at various stages of his career. Similarly, his pay and allowances conform to the class of the category in which he is mustered/remustered during his service.\\n\\n35. Grouping. The Army manpower has four major divisions, i.e., firstly, \"officers\", secondly, \"JCOs and ORs,\" thirdly, \"Non-combatants (Enrolled)\" and fourthly, \"civilians [including \"Non-combatants (unenrolled)]\". \"JCOs and ORs\" will be referred to herein as \"soldiers\". Whereas, for manpower purposes, officers are not formed into groups, the soldiers have been placed in eight groups, \\'A\\' to \\'H\\', according to the categories to which they belong. Each category has one or more classes of skill (for ORs only). The soldier\\'s career is divided into two main parts i.e., \"Recruit\" and \"Trained Soldier\". A soldier is enrolled as a recruit either on normal entry, metric entry or skilled entry rate, applicable to the category for which he possesses necessary physical, educational and technical qualifications at the time of enrolment. After successful completion of the recruit training and achievement of the minimum qualifications required for the lowest class of his category, he becomes a trained soldier. Thereafter, Lance appointment and grant of NCO, WO and JCO ranks are governed by the normal rules.\\n\\nThe eligibility for a higher class is earned by a soldier after obtaining certain qualifications. The upclassification of fully qualified personnel is regulated by the number of vacancies in each class within the authorised establishment of each regiment, corps or unit.\\n\\n36. The \"classes\" apply up to and including NCOs. The rank and lance appointment of the category \"clerk\" are allied with the class, as under:\\n\\n|Class 1|....|Havildar|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Class 2|....|Naik|\\n|Class 3 and 4|....|Lance Naiks and Sepoys in the proportion of one Lance Naik to two Sepoys.|\\n\\nNote:- The term \"clerk\" includes Clerks GD, Clerks Store and Storemen Technical.\\n\\n37. The ranks and lance appointments of other categories are independent of their classes. Full details regarding grouping, categories, classifications and qualifications of soldiers and NCs (E) are laid down in the Pay and Allowance Regulations Volume I.\\n\\n38. Change in grouping, classification and qualifications deletion or modification of existing and introduction of new categories of soldiers are based on the technical and administrative requirements.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Their further training and employment are accordingly regulated by these considerations.\\n\\n# Accounting.\\n\\n# 40.\\n\\nAuthorization of Manpower. The authorized numbers, ranks, appointments, classes and grades of manpower are laid down in various establishments sanctioned by the Government. See also AR (I) 95.\\n\\n# 41.\\n\\nAccounting. Every individual borne on the strength of the Army must be correctly and promptly accounted for at all times. For this purpose, personal and statistical records will be maintained at units, Records Officers, Army Headquarters etc., according to the Instructions of the Chief of Army Staff.\\n\\n# 42.\\n\\nThe following media regulate the over-all accounting of manpower:\\n\\n1. The Effective List. Personnel actually holding Army appointments/ posts are borne on this list including those who are held supernumerary to unit strength according to the note appended to Rules 45 and 47. This list is divided in two parts, containing strength of personnel shown therein:\\n\\n1. Part A—All officers of the rank of Lieut-Colonel and below, soldiers, NC (E), NC (U) and civilians, by Arms Services, Regiments Corps, Units and Formations (including Staff and ERE). [Nonregular officers borne on the General List (Rule 187) are also proforma posted and held against Arm/services list in this Part, shown as \"General List\"].\\n2. Part B—Special List—all officers of the rank of Colonel and above.\\n\\nPersonnel of the regular army covered under sub-rules (b) (i) and (d) below also form part of this list.\\n2. The Supernumerary List. This is maintained in two Sections namely:\\n\\n1. Section I— All personnel whose services have been placed at the disposal of Government or Civil Departments of the Government and who are subject to reversion/recall to military duty. These personnel are over and above the strength of the Effective List authorised under sub rule (a) above.\\n2. Section II—All personnel who are transferred permanently to Government, are struck off the Effective List and are not subject to compulsory recall to military duty.\\n3. The Reserve List.

Subject to the provisions of Rule 142, the principle of temporary promotion is that when an officer actually performs the duties of an appointment he will be given an appropriate temporary rank carried by that appointment, if that rank is available for him even if it is intended to replace him as soon as a more experienced or more suitable officer is posted. A temporary promotion will therefore, be made to fill an existing vacancy including one created under Rule 133, except under its sub-rule (q), (r) or (4) in which case normally only temporary arrangement will be made for the performance of the duties of the appointment vacated by the accused and the promotion of the officer so appointed temporarily will be published only after the conviction of the accused officer is announced. Further, as an exception to Rule 133 (j), and without prejudice to the right of the outgoing officer to any pay and allowances attached to the appointment, temporary promotion is also permissible in place of a British officer proceeding on accumulated leave on final termination of his service with the Bangladesh Army and in place of a Lieut-Colonel and above proceeding on leave pending retirement/release from the date the outgoing officer is struck off duty. Temporary promotion is effective from the date of assumption of appointment, unless otherwise specified in the appointment letter.\\n\\n214. Eligibility.

However, a deserter, who is apprehended/surrenders in West Pakistan and his unit is in East Pakistan, or vice versa; or the unit is on active service; or at a distance of more than five hundred miles from its regimental/corps centre, to which the deserter surrenders or which takes him over on apprehension, he will be taken on the attached strength of his parent regimental/corps centre, provided it is located in the', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The officer commanding of the regimental/corps centre/unit to which a deserter is thus attached will be legally competent to try him by summary court-martial, provided evidence, particularly evidence of identification is available with that centre/unit.\\n\\nNothing in this Rule shall limit the powers of any convening officer, who, at his discretion, may order trial by general, field general or district court-martial, if such a course appears to him to be desirable in the interests of discipline.\\n\\n# Anonymous Letters.\\n\\n316. Anonymous letters should invariably be destroyed without being docketed or noted on. However, a Head of a Branch/Directorate at AHQ and an officer commanding unit/formation commander may direct action on such a letter if it is of an exceptional nature, for example, where it appears to supply a vital missing link in evidence if an enquiry was already contemplated and proceeding drawn up against some offender.\\n\\nAnonymous letters will, therefore, be diarized only if the aforementioned authority orders action to be taken thereon.\\n\\n# Prohibition Against Employment.\\n\\n317. General. No person who is NOT a citizen of Bangladesh can, except with the consent of the Government signified in writing be employed in the army. See also AR (I) 238.\\n\\n318. Dismissed/Removed Persons. As a rule:-\\n\\n- (a) Dismissal/removal under the Bangladesh Army Act does not automatically constitute a bar against future employment by Government, nor a civilian dismissed from military employs is debarred from re-employment by government.\\n- (b) A civilian dismissed from a government civil department, is, however automatically precluded from further government service.\\n- (c) The decision whether are not a person may be re-employed after dismissal/removal from the army is an administrative matter, depending upon the merits of each case.\\n\\n319. The exact reason for dismissal/removal will always be given and general terms such as \"undesirable character\" or \"unsuitable for government employment\", etc., will NOT be used.\\n\\n320. The final authority for prohibition of employment rests with the government. Recommendations from units/formations will be forwarded to the Adjutant General, AHQ, for obtaining government orders. A monthly list of persons dismissed or debarred from government service is published and circulated by the government which must be referred to when employing any person in the army.\\n\\n# Other Government, Business and Commercial Employment.\\n\\n321.

To Officers— By the Chief of Army Staff. Such permission after leave pending retirement is required only when the employment is taken within two years of retirement. Permission granted during leave pending retirement will hold good even after the expiry of that leave.\\n2. To Soldiers—By their Regiment/Corps Centre Commanders. (Permission is required only for employment during leave pending discharge/retirement, transfer to the reserve or pension establishment).\\n\\n# (b) For Employment Outside Bangladesh.\\n\\nPermission of the Government of Bangladesh will be required before taking up such employment, at any time after the commencement of leave pending retirement and/or retirement.\\n\\nThe detailed procedure is laid down in Army Regulations (Instruction) No. 241.\\n\\n# 323. Failure to obtain the above permission\\n\\nFailure to obtain the above permission before taking up employment may result in the forfeiture of pension for any period for which the person is so employed or such longer period as the Government of Bangladesh may decide.\\n\\n# 324. Explanation of Terms\\n\\nThe destination of the term \"Commercial Employment\" as given in Article 531-B Civil service regulations will apply.\\n\\n# 325. Contracts\\n\\nExcept as hereinafter stated, no contract whether for the purchase or sale by a Defence Service of goods or services, will be entered into with an officer or soldier, or any partnership of which he is a member (apart from a company in which he is shareholder), or any company of which he is a director (except as a nominee of the government), unless permission has been obtained from the Government for the purchase or sale to proceed.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Every Non-Commissioned officer or man, who loses a rifle, light automatic, carbine, revolver, pistol or rifle belt whether government property or private, if borne in the unit arms register, or grenade or sixteen or more rounds of ball ammunition for any of the arms mentioned in this paragraph, will be tried by a District Court Martial, unless, sanction to dispense with the trial is obtained from the Carps/Division/Sub Area/Independent Brigade Commander, as the case may be. The formation commander concerned may order a trial by Summary Court Martial if a District Court Martial is inconvenient e.g., when a unit is isolated.\\n\\n330. Public or Regimental Property. Disciplinary action, whether by summary, award, trial by court martial or prosecution before a civil court, as applicable will be taken against any person considered to be responsible for laws of public or regimental property by fraud or theft.\\n\\nWhere, after a full investigation, any person is considered to be responsible for loss of public or regimental property otherwise than by fraud or theft, and it is not desired to have recourse to trial, the matter will be referred to the government with the recommendations of all forwarding authorities stating whether the amount should be recovered in whole or in part from the person concerned, together with any reason which he may have to urge against recovery.\\n\\n331. Improper Use of Railway Forms. Officers and subordinates authorized to hold railway forms, including concession vouchers, will be held responsible for any improper use of such forms—see Rule 3, Passage Regulations. When a loss to a railway administration results from the misuse of a railway form and this cannot be recovered from the individual who misused it, the matter will be referred to the government through proper channels, in the same manner as in Rule 330.\\n\\n332. Damage by Fire. An officer, soldier or any other person in military employ will be liable to make good damage done to government property by a fire which is the result of his own neglect but in view of the large sum to which liability may extend in such cases, the amount to be recovered usually will be limited to a sum NOT exceeding one week's pay of the individual who is held responsible.\\n\\n333.

General. The orders regarding saluting are laid down in the Army Regulations (Instructions) Nos. 246-250.\\n\\n337. Junior Commissioned Officers Holding Honorary Rank as Bangladesh Commissioned Officers. In view of Rule 249, such Junior Commissioned Officers will not salute other Junior Commissioned Officers, who are otherwise senior to them, but will salute all Bangladesh Commissioned Officers, irrespective of rank.\\n\\n# Discipline Reports.\\n\\n338. Injury to a Civilian. When a civilian is injured by a person subject to military law, the officer commanding unit will report the matter immediately to the officer commanding Station, his own formation headquarters, the district magistrate and the local police and commence a thorough investigation in order to ascertain the fact whilst the incident is fresh. If the civil authorities investigate the case, the officer commanding unit will give them every assistance. The medical officer who first attends an injured person will report forthwith to the civil and military authorities concerned the nature and extent of the injuries and his opinion as to the probable results.\\n\\n339. Delay Reports. Reports giving reasons for the delay between committal and court martial are governed by Bangladesh Army Act, Section 75 and Bangladesh Army Act, Rule 166.

Officers and Soldiers Serving in Civil Departments. Officers and soldiers whose services are loaned to or placed at the disposal of a civil government or department remain amenable to Military law until they are released from the army and absorbed in that department. Such persons are solely under the control of that department but by this they are not relieved of, when occasion arises, to obey their military superiors.\\n\\nIf any individual of the aforementioned category commits an offence, he will be dealt with as follows:—\\n\\n- (a) If the offence is one solely connected with his civil duties, the head of the department is his \"Commanding Officer\" and competent to dispose of the case departmentally.\\n- (b) If the offence falls under any Section of the Bangladesh Army Act e.g. disobedience of or insubordination to a military superior, the matter will be reported to the Head of the Department. The offender may be placed under arrest, if considered necessary by the military superior.\\n\\nIf it is decided to take disciplinary action against him, the head of the department will refer the case to the nearest formation headquarters (including a station commander), for attachment of the offender to a unit of the army. The formation commander/station commander concerned, if he holds a court martial warrant, will be the deciding authority regarding the method of disposal i.e., trial by court martial or summarily.\\n\\n347.

Legal Advice and Engagement of Counsel for the Prosecution. When the Army is directly interested financially or otherwise, in the prosecution in a civil court, of an offender whether subject to BAA or not, the solicitor of the local government where the accused is prosecuted should be employed, or when the prosecution is directly controlled from Army Headquarters, the Solicitor to the Government, who will, if necessary, take further advice from the Advocate General or the Government Advocate, according to the province in which the prosecution is being conducted.\\n\\nNo prosecution shall be instituted without adequate legal advice being taken in writing and no prosecution shall be instituted or withdrawn in any manner contrary to such legal advice without reference to the Government.

Claiming the Accused for Trial\\n\\nUnder Section 91, BAA, it rests in the discretion of the prescribed officer given in BAA Rule 168 to decide whether the proceedings shall be instituted before a court-martial or before a civil (Criminal) court. However, if the civil (Criminal) court issues a written notice under Section 95, BAA, and upon receipt of such a notice, the prescribed officer decides not to hand over or deliver the offender as required by the said notice, then the said prescribed officer will forthwith refer the question of the trial for determination by the Government.

For example, a sepoy, who was sentry when a theft occurred, is acquitted by the civil court on charge of theft or complicity therein, but it came out that he was found asleep on his post, could be then tried by a court-martial under Section 22 (a) BAA.\\n\\n# 372.

Function of Command. Administration is one of the functions of command. Subject to the rules laid down by the Government, the Chief of Army Staff is responsible, through his staff at AHQ and subordinate commanders, to prescribe and implement the policy regarding the general Administration of the army.\\n\\nEvery commander in turn will ensure that within the framework of the Chief of Army Staff\\'s policy, his own and other units placed under his command or control are working efficiently and economically, and are always fit to achieve their respective tasks. Officers of Arms and Services are responsible to bring to the notice of the Commanders concerned any misuse and waste including uneconomical methods in the system of their organization, as laid down in Rule 17.\\n\\n# Administration of Stores, Supplies and Funds.\\n\\n421. All individuals are responsible that the expenditure of government stores, supplies and funds in their charge is conducted honestly and economically, in accordance with regulations and accounted for properly. In the event of failure in this respect, the responsibility lies with the individual incurring the expenditure unless his decision was overruled by a superior authority, who then becomes answerable for the irregularity.\\n\\nAttention of all concerned will be drawn to Chapter V, Financial Regulations, Part II, and Rules in FR Part I regarding their responsibility and procedure for dealing with losses, wastage and damage to public property.\\n\\n# Responsibility for Expenditure.\\n\\n422. Expenditure other than that covered by rules will not be incurred without the prior sanction of the competent Financial Authority. In urgent cases, however, where time does not permit of a prior reference to the Competent Financial Authority, the senior military officer may accord permission and report his action to the CFA as soon as possible. Officers authorizing expenditure not covered by rules do so on their own responsibility and will convey their sanction in writing.\\n\\n# Prohibition on Lending.\\n\\n423. Any person in charge of public stores and supplies of any kind is strictly forbidden to lend any article under his charge for any purpose, unless permitted to do so by his Commanding Officer.\\n\\n# Handing/Taking Over Charge.\\n\\n424. General. Every officer in charge of Government money or stores will, on handing over charge, check the cash and/or stores in his custody in company with the officer who relieves him. The term \"in his custody\" includes cash, stores, etc., in physical charge of a subordinate.\\n\\nA transfer of charge will always take place when an officer vacates an appointment permanently, or when he proceeds on leave, provided it is known that on return from leave he will not re-assume the charge of the appointment from which he proceeded on leave.

In the case of AOC establishments, the relieving officer will satisfy himself that the stores have been regularly verified and that departmental instructions for their care and maintenance have been correctly observed.\\n\\nThe duplicate copy of BAFZ-2081 will be forwarded to the audit officer immediately after signature.\\n\\nAny omission to furnish these certificates renders the relieving officer responsible for his predecessor's liabilities. Lists of all damaged property and discrepancies will be made out (BAFZ-2098) and attached to the transfer certificates. Whenever cash or stores are transferred from one charge to another, a temporary receipt will be taken in anticipation, if necessary, of the issue of formal receipt vouchers.\\n\\n# 427.\\n\\nIf an officer in charge of government property dies or is admitted to hospital before being duly relieved, the senior officer present will provide for the security of such government moneys, stores, supplies, etc., and will at once see that they are properly taken over e.g., by a board of officers, which may include a junior commissioned officer/warrant officer, if necessary.\\n\\n# 428.\\n\\nChange of Command. On a change of Command, a unit stocktaking board will be assembled (but See Rule 429) to take stock and verify ledger balances. The convening officer may requisition the services of an ordnance representative available in the station or a junior commissioned officer/non-commissioned officer of another unit who is not directly concerned with the amounting of, or the charge of the stores in question.

The successor will be held to accept the property as assessed when the Officer Commanding Station took it over.\\n\\n# 429.\\n\\nThe stock-taking board may be dispensed with if the officer taking over charge considers it unnecessary. This discretion will be expressed in writing. The certificate given in Rule 428 will, however, be signed.\\n\\n# 430.\\n\\nDiscrepancies. If any difference of opinion arises between the officer giving over and receiving charge, regarding the condition, description and quantity of stores etc., on charge, a station board will be convened by the Officer Commanding Station to report on the matter. The opinion of such a board will be binding on both officers. The board will state the cause to which in its opinion, the discrepancies are due and will forward the proceedings to the Officer Commanding Station for disposal. Discrepancies will be dealt with according to Rule 75 (vi), FR Part I.\\n\\n# Insurance.\\n\\n# 431.\\n\\nAs it is more economical for the State to carry its own risks in respect of government owned property, rather than cover such risks by insurance, the general rule is that Defence Service property should not be insured unless there is some specific reason for exceptional treatment. Cases where insurance is considered to be necessary will be referred for government orders through normal channels.\\n\\n# Change of Name.\\n\\n# 432.\\n\\nThe procedure for the change of name on the part of military personnel is given in Appendix \"J\" to these Rules.\\n\\n# Holidays.\\n\\n# 433.\\n\\nOrders for and list of closed holidays are published annually in Army Instructions; any additional or special holiday may be declared separately by the Government.

Funds are of three kinds viz., Public, Regimental and Private. Their definitions are given at page (xvi) of these Rules.\\n\\nThe rules governing the maintenance, audit, etc., of Regimental Funds are also applicable to Private Funds.\\n\\n# Responsibility.\\n\\n437. Every officer is responsible for all public and regimental funds entrusted to him. He cannot refuse to take charge of them. He will see that they are expended in strict conformity with current rules and regulations, issued under government, AHQ or other superior authority. He will keep precise records of all his monetary transactions, temporary or permanent, including any transactions that may take place between him and other officers or units, in a form complying with relevant regulations or instructions.\\n\\n# Custody.\\n\\n438. Banking and Deposit. Public and regimental funds must be banked and their cash balances held in proper custody—see Rule 444. These will not be kept in the private possession of any officer or other person, nor will they be deposited to the credit of a private account. Separate bank accounts must be maintained for public and regimental funds (vide Rule 113, Financial Regulations, Part II).\\n\\nCheque books will be kept in the safe of the officer in charge of the fund.\\n\\n439. Treasure Chests. Every unit will maintain a treasure chest for keeping all cash, cheques etc., relating to public as well as regimental funds. Treasure chests and their accessories will be provided at State expense and maintained as unit stores. The officer commanding unit will be responsible for ensuring its security, and custody of keys.

This will not apply to the MES. See also AR (Instruction) 389.\\n\\n# 440. Holding of Post Office Cash Certificates in a Fiduciary Capacity\\n\\nEvery army officer (including a CGO in military employ) and a CMA is authorized to hold P. O. Cash Certificates in fiduciary capacity, in the name of the office, subject to the condition that the value of the cash certificates, purchased on behalf of any one person shall not exceed taka ten thousand.\\n\\n# Accounting\\n\\n# 441. Accounts and Cheques\\n\\nAll entries in cash and account books etc., of all funds, will be made in ink. Primarily the duty of writing up the cash book etc., is that of the officer in charge of the fund, but he may delegate this duty to a subordinate, subject to his exercising direct supervision over all money transactions and personally checking and initialling all entries in account books, journals etc. He is not in any way relieved of financial responsibility by this delegation of duty. Bank and Treasure Chest deposit and payment cheques/slips may be prepared by a clerk for the signature of the officer concerned, who will be responsible for their correctness. Alterations in cheques must be attested by the officer maintaining the Account by signatures in full.\\n\\nThe foregoing rule also applies to formation and station headquarters where the duty of writing up cash books, cheques, etc., may be delegated to a senior JCO or NCO clerk. In ordnance and MES establishments, factories, etc., this duty may be similarly entrusted to a responsible subordinate. See also Rule 443.\\n\\n# 442. Accounts of Sub-Units\\n\\nCommanding officers of units are responsible that the accounts of their squadrons, companies or equivalent sub-units are maintained in conformity with the regulations, and the rules relating to distribution of pay etc., are strictly complied with. They will require every officer in charge of a fund in their units to render a certificate monthly, to the effect that the cash in hand has been compared with the cash/account book and the balances shown therein have been found correct or otherwise explained by a reconciliation statement to be attached to or entered on the said certificate. This reconciliation is in addition to the one entered in the account book. Immediate action will be taken for the settlement of discrepancies between book and cash balances, which remain non-reconciled. In cases where funds are directly under the control of the officer commanding unit, he will carry out the said check personally and record the fact in the relevant account books. Sub-unit commanders may at anytime be called upon to produce before the C.O. the cash balance in hand of the funds under their charge.\\n\\nIn units where accounts are maintained in accordance with the pamphlet \"Regimental Accounts, Bangladesh Army\", officers in charge of funds (Fund officers) will only submit the stipulated Form BAFA-120 every month certifying thereon that the balances of the funds maintained by them as shown on the said Form are correct and agree with the balances in their accounts.

Handling of Cash.\\n\\nNo person below the rank of an officer, will normally be subjected to the risk of financial loss by having public or regimental money, whether in the form of cash or otherwise, placed in his hands, nor will he be charged with the custody of forms of authority for the use of money, for example, drafts, cheques, money orders etc., except as laid down in these or other government regulations. The following are authorized exceptions to this rule:\\n\\n1. A Junior Commissioned Officer is allowed to handle cash and maintain accounts when:\\n1. serving in the vacancy of an officer and drawing acting allowance.\\n2. appointed by the officer commanding as a cashier of the unit Treasure Chest.\\n3. especially authorized to do so on behalf of the Imprest Holder.

Civilian personnel employed in lower formations of the army against the authorized posts of cashiers/Assistant cashiers are permitted to handle cash and keep account for or on behalf of the cash officer or officer responsible for the funds, subject to the condition that such civilian personnel furnish security bonds/cash security as required under relevant regulations.\\n5. In MES, this rule may be relaxed according to MES Regulations.\\n\\nProvided that the foregoing relaxations will in no way minimise the responsibility of the officer commanding unit or the fund officer concerned, regarding check, custody and correct disposal of the money handled by these subordinates and the accuracy of all transactions and accounts.\\n\\n# (B)—Public Funds.\\n\\n# Banking.\\n\\n444. Public funds will be deposited in any nationalised Bank of Bangladesh.

Every officer charged with the disbursement of pay is responsible that those serving under him receive the amounts due to them.\\n\\nAll fines and deductions will be notified in orders and explained to the individual concerned. Every man will examine his account and sign or affix his thumb impression to the acquittance roll or pay bill, thumb impressions will be attested by the paying officer, who will verify the correct receipt by questioning the payee. All cash payments will be made in the presence of an officer. If a sub-unit commander does not disburse the pay himself, he will after disbursement, personally ascertain from all payees that they have received the payment in full.\\n\\nA subordinate of the Military Engineering Services may, however, be authorized to make payments within the limitations imposed by the Regulations for the Military Engineer Services.\\n\\n# Emergency Cash Requisitions\\n\\n446. Advances on Emergency Cash Requisitions (Defence Services) are regulated according to Rules 58 and 180 (iv), Financial Regulations Part II, Rule 117 (ii), Pay and Allowance Regulations, Volume II, and Rule 128, Passage Regulations.\\n\\nSuch advances must be drawn on the prescribed form which is issued in bound books.

The officer issuing the requisition will be responsible for any unauthorized or irregular advance he orders. For prior concurrence of the audit officer for an advance, see the rules in the regulations mentioned in Rule 446. If necessary, such concurrence may be obtained telegraphically.\\n\\n449. The individual receiving the advance will present the requisition and a receipt, in duplicate, marked \"emergent\", at the treasury or bank on which it is drawn.\\n\\n450.

The commanding officer's position in relation to regimental funds is that of trustee for the personnel of his unit. He is, therefore, responsible for the proper application, according to the object of each fund, for the benefit of the personnel or unit as a whole, or in certain cases, for the benefit of subscribers to the fund. The commanding officer will be personally responsible for any portion of the funds which may be misapplied or suffer a loss owing to any neglect on his part, provided that nothing in this rule shall apply to any investment in a concern or business, approved by the Government.\\n\\nThe commanding officer may delegate detailed administration of funds to a subordinate officer or selected other ranks serving under his command, but this delegation does not relieve him of his responsibility that the money etc., entrusted to them is properly administered and used.\\n\\n# Banking.\\n\\n452. Authorized Banks. Regimental funds may be deposited with any branch of the Sonali Bank of Bangladesh, or with any Bangladesh Scheduled Bank, or where banking facilities are not available in a civil treasury. Deposits with Scheduled banks will be subject to Rules 453 to 457.\\n\\n453. Only banks which have entered into an agreement on BAFA- 301 or 301-A, or on both, and lodged a security deposit with a Controller of Military Accounts (Rule 195, FR Part I) will be employed for the banking of regimental funds. The security to be furnished by the banks will be securities guaranteed by the Govt. of Bangladesh, taka paper, cash, stock certificates, port trust or municipal bonds and debentures. All such securities will be lodged with the Controller of Military Accounts in whose accounts area the head office of the bank concerned is situated in Bangladesh. The value of the Security deposit will be limited to 50% of the amount of regimental funds held by the banks.\\n\\n454. Procedure. Before making a deposit, for the first time, the commanding officer will obtain the sanction of the Controller of Military Accounts in whose accounts area the head office of the selected bank is located in Bangladesh. Subsequent deposits with the same bank may be made without further reference to the Controller of Military Accounts provided they do not increase the amount of the original deposit in respect of which sanction was previously given, by five thousand taka or over.\\n\\nIn his application to the Controller of Military Accounts, the commanding officer will clearly state :\\n\\n- (a) The name or designation of the Bank with which he proposes to deposit his funds, the location of the branch with which he proposes to deal and the head office in Bangladesh.\\n- (b) That the bank is willing to receive his deposit and will lodge the required security with government.\\n- (c) The nomenclature of funds to be deposited.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Half Yearly Reports.\\n\\nIn January and July of every year, the commanding officer will obtain from each bank holding funds belonging to his unit a statement (BAF- CMA- 248) of the total balance to his credit on the last day of the previous month which must include all moneys held by the bank on current account or fixed deposit. The commanding officer will certify on this statement that it agrees with his regimental accounts and will forward it without delay direct to the Controller of Military Accounts in whose audit area the head office of the bank in Bangladesh is located.\\n\\nThis rule does not apply to units/formations who maintain their regimental funds with the Sonali Bank of Bangladesh.\\n\\n# 456. CO's Responsibility.\\n\\nIt must be clearly understood that all deposits of regimental funds remain the personal responsibility of the commanding officer. The above procedure has been laid down to make it possible for units to bank their regimental funds with the minimum of risk. The commanding officer is in no way relieved of the responsibility which rests upon him in taking every precaution for the safety of the regimental funds entrusted to his care. Government will not recoup loss arising from the failure of the bank or firm, or from any other cause, should the security deposit prove insufficient. Depositing officers will therefore be solely responsible for any loss which may result from delay or omission in submission of the half yearly reports under Rule 455.\\n\\n# 457. CMA's Responsibility.\\n\\nThe Controller of Military Accounts is not concerned in detailed work connected with regimental funds such as settling rates of interest, or watching credit of such interest, arranging for transfer of money from current account to fixed deposit, checking amounts paid into or withdrawn from accounts or dealing with points in dispute between the depositor and the bank. Such matters appertain solely to the internal management of the funds and remain to be settled directly between the officer commanding unit and the bank.\\n\\n# 458. Sale of Securities.\\n\\nAn officer commanding unit is NOT permitted to give banks thus employed by him any general power of attorney or other authority which would enable the bank, forthwith to sell securities the property of a regimental fund, which are deposited with them. The commanding officer must, if he wishes sale of any securities, expressly instruct the bank in each individual case to do so.\\n\\n# Investment.\\n\\n# 459.\\n\\nRegimental funds of units and formations may only be invested in Government of Bangladesh Securities.

See also Rules 451 and 456.\\n\\nSee also AR (Instruction) 405-406 for powers to sanction expenditure and write off of losses.\\n\\n# Extra Remuneration.\\n\\n461. The grant of extra remuneration to serving soldiers and non-combatants from regimental funds is permissible only when the individual concerned performs work which is the benefit of the unit and which is entirely outside, and in addition to, his normal military duties.\\n\\n# Audit.\\n\\n462. The audit of regimental funds will be carried out regimentally. The Military Accounts Department are NOT responsible for this work. However, a corps, divisional, sub area or brigade commander may call upon the Controller of Military Accounts concerned to inspect and report upon the regimental funds of any particular unit. The Controller of Military Accounts' function in this respect is limited to inspection and submission of the required report, any further action thereon being entirely left to the discretion of the formation commander.\\n\\n463. Quarterly Audit Board. At the end of each quarter, the commanding officer will assemble an audit board consisting of three senior officers present, to check all public accounts and cash balances and to audit the accounts of all regimental funds.

In order to destroy this type, it is necessary to dig it up completely, remove the queen and expose the contents of the nest to the sun for two to three days. Thereafter, the contents should be raked with a mixture of 20% Cresote to 80% used Mineral oil, and replaced.\\n- (b) Diffuse Type. This type of nest is extremely difficult to eradicate, as it may extend over a large area and may not show any external signs beyond the characteristic runs. This type may be destroyed by completely flooding the area in which the nest is suspected. The period of flooding should extend over four weeks.\\n\\n(2) Mere elimination of the queen ant or the destruction of runs is useless unless the nest from which the white ants is completely destroyed.\\n\\n# Barrack Damages.\\n\\n519. When a unit receives orders to leave a station and the unit lines are handed over, barrack damages, if any, will be listed and roughly assessed by the Military Engineering Services.

The total number of clerks General Duty/clerks Store/storemen technical authorized is the aggregate of the basic establishment of the regiment/corps for its own units i.e., \"Parent Arm/Service\", PLUS the authorization on \"User Arm\" i.e., Extra Regimental Employment etc.\\n\\n2. The ranks/classes of the foregoing categories are NOT specified in establishment except for clerks under Rule 56. The \"clerks\" may thus be shown in an establishment in any one of the following ways:\\n\\n- (a) By total number only e.g., \"20 clerks\", without specifying rank/class;\\n- (b) by specifying rank/class e.g., 4 JCOs (which means the lowest rank viz., Jemader) and 6 class 1 and 10 class 2 clerks; OR so many Subedar Majors/Subedars/Jemadars, class 1,2 and so on;\\n- (c) a mixture of both (a) and (b) above e.g.:\\n- 1 Subedar Major.\\n- 2 Subedars.\\n- 3 Jemadars.\\n- 14 Clerks.\\n\\n3. ILLUSTRATION. Assuming the \"total authorized establishment\" of a corps as 608 clerks, comprising 580 shown by total number and 28 by ranks/classes and its further subdivision being as under:\\n\\n| |For Parent Arm/Service.|For User Arm/Service.|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|(a) Clerks shown only by total number...|500|80|\\n|(b) Clerks shown by rank/classes :| | |\\n|Subedar Major|= 1|--|\\n|Subedar|= --|3|\\n|Jemadar|= 2|15|\\n|Class 1|= 5|5|\\n|Class 2|= 5|5|\\n|(c) Total|513|95|', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Now to obtain the total rank/class structure of the corps in question, the 580 clerks are first broken into different ranks/classes according to the authorized proportions given in AR Rule 36 and 157 and Pay and Allowance Regulations Volume I (1952) Rule 1E6. The specified ranks/classes are then added to the result. The sum total of these two sets of figures become the total rank structure of that corps, that is:\\n\\n| |Subedar Major|Subedar|Jemadar|Class 1 (Havildar)|Class 2|Class 3 (Naik/Lance Naik/Sepoy)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|(a) One 580 clerks|3|10|41|96|192|238|\\n|(b) the 28 specified rank/classes|1|3|4|10|10|-|\\n|Total =|4|13|45|106|202|238|\\n\\n*In the proportions of one Lance Naik to two sepoys.\\n\\n5. The above calculations are based on the following fundamental principles:\\n\\n- (a) Normal Rank/Class structure obtained on the basis of clerks shown by \"total number\" does not cater for the duties of appointments for which any ranks/classes have been specified. Hence specified ranks/classes are counted over and above normal structure.\\n- (b) Extra regimental appointments are integral part of the regiment/corps establishment for accounting and promotion purposes. These appointments are, therefore, added to the parent arm authorization for rank/class structure.\\n- (c) Specified ranks/classes are added once only i.e., after obtaining the normal rank structure.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
